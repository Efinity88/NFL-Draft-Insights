# NFL-Draft-Insights
Using the ProSportsDraftData package in R, I wanted to gain an understanding to what makes a first round NFL pick.
I created a Random Forest Model which looked at the combine results for defensive lineman. 
I looked at the 40 Yard Dash, Vertical Jump and Bench Press to see if they influence draft position.
I looked at the college they went to, the conference they played in as well as the stats.
I also looked at other factors such as NFL Combine, exhibiton games and also interviews which may affect draft stock.
