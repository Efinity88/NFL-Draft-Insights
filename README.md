# NFL-Draft-Insights
Using the ProSportsDraftData package in R, I wanted to gain an understanding to what makes a first rounf NFL pick.
I looked at the college they went to, the conference they played in as well as the stats.
I also looked at other factors such as NFL Combine, exhibiton games and also interviews which may affect draft stock.
